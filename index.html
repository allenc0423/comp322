<!--Short bio-->
<body>
<p>My name is Cameron Allen and I am a Junior Computer Science student at NC A&T. I am originally from Winston-Salem, NC.
    I enjoy playing videogames, coding personal projects, or creating music in my free time. 
    I hope gain a better understanding  of web development from this course, and learn more about how I can incorporate these skills into new personal projects</p>
